# Introduction

Welcome to the **Algorithms and Data Structures** module!

During this module you will learn how to design and implement an algorithm.
Take a look at the code samples from this repository. Try to understand and implement yourself 
both the algorithms and data structures that ar provided as examples.

Data Structures are very important and are used daily by any developer.
Pay extra attention to them and solve the bellow exercises in order to be well prepared 
for the next modules.

## Exercises
* **Algorithms**
1.  Given an array of integers find the second largest element from the array.
2.  Write an algorithm that checks if an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome 
when it reads the same backward as forward. Example: 1221 is a palindrome.

* **Data Structures**
1.  Implement a single linked list with the following methods:
    * ``add`` - adda new element to the list
    * ``remove`` - remove an element from the list
2.  Implement a stack-LIFO (by using a single linked list or an array) with the following methods:
    * ``push`` - pushes a new element on top of the stack
    * ``pop`` - removes and returns the top element of the stack
    * ``peek`` - returns the element on top of the stack but does not remove it
    * ``empty`` - returns true if there is no element on top of the stack. Else return false.
3.  Implement a queue-FIFO (by using a single linked list) with the following methods:
    * ``enqueue`` - add a new element at the end of the queue
    * ``dequeue``- returns and removes the first element
    * ``front`` - returns the first element without removing it
